TODOS
=====

* Simplify functions that find lowest price
* Figure out standard way of returning lowest price data
    * Store object? Product object? Custom object? 
    * Probably push some of the formatting and display logic to the view or controller, instead of the model
* Create sum view that actually adds up your total costs
* Specify limits/restrictions/discounts, like Fresh Direct coupon
* Organize data
    * Specify standard, human-friendly units, like pounds instead of ounces
